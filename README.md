Basics of Pandas â€“ AI Engineering

# This repository contains my practices work on the fundamentals of Pandas, which is one of the most important libraries for data analysis and AI Engineering.

The goal of this stage is to focus only on the basics, not the advanced topics. I wanted to make sure that I fully understand how Pandas works at its core, by solving tasks and exercises on every essential part.

# In this repository, I practiced step by step on: 

# Creating Series and DataFrames
I learned how to build data structures in Pandas to represent and organize data in a clear way.

# Exploring and understanding the data
I used functions like head(), tail(), info(), and describe() to quickly check the dataset and get useful summaries.

# Accessing and selecting data
I worked with both loc[] and iloc[] to access rows and columns by labels or by index positions.

# Modifying and updating values
I practiced changing and updating specific elements inside the DataFrame.

# Sorting data
I used sort_values() and sort_index() to reorder the data in different ways.

# Filtering with conditions
I solved exercises where I needed to select rows that match certain conditions, for example filtering numbers above a limit or selecting specific categories.

Through these tasks, I made sure to apply each concept in practice rather than just reading about it. This way, I can use Pandas confidently for basic data manipulation.

Why this stage matters:
Building a strong foundation in Pandas is very important before moving to advanced analysis and AI projects. By completing these exercises, I now have a clear understanding of how to handle data in Pandas, and I am ready to continue with more advanced features in the future.
